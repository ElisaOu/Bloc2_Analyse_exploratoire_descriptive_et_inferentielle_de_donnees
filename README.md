# Speed dating : What are the triggers to match ?


## Context and goals of this study:

The Speed Dating networking application did provide us with a dataset containing lots of information about their users, gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004.

For this notebook the problematic chosen to be explored is **what are the triggers to match ?**.


This study is an EDA project and thus uses descriptive statistics and visualisations
